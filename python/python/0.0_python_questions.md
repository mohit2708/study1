### Python Libraries Interview Questions
1. Differentiate between a package and a module in python.

1. Ques:-What is the Python “with” statement designed for?




### **Ques. What are global, protected and private attributes in Python?**
* **Global variables** are public variables that are defined in the global scope. To use the variable in the global scope inside a function, we use the **global** keyword.
* **Protected attributes** are attributes defined with an **single underscore** prefixed to their identifier eg. _mohit. They can still be accessed and modified from outside the class they are defined in but a responsible developer should refrain from doing so.
* **Private attributes** are attributes with **double underscore** prefixed to their identifier eg. __mohit. They cannot be accessed or modified from the outside directly and will result in an AttributeError if such an attempt is made.



### **Python Collections (Arrays)?**
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
 * **List** is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
 * **Tuple** is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
 * **Set** is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
 * **Dictionary** is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.






### **Ques. What is built-in module in Python?**
https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html<br>
Example
```python
>>> import html
>>> import html.parser
import mysql.connector
```
ye buil in packege hote hai<br>
agar or karne hai to pip ki help sa karenge



### **Ques. How is memory managed in Python?**
* Memory management in Python is handled by the **Python Memory Manager**. 
* Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused memory and so that it can be made available to the heap space.
* Memory management in python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. The programmer does not have access to this private heap. The python interpreter takes care of this instead.
* The allocation of heap space for Python objects is done by Python’s memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.


### **Ques. What is Map, Filter, Reduce?**
sdafasf
fasf
das
f


### String to array:-
```python
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
str1 = ' '.join(thislist)
counter = dict.fromkeys(str1, 0)
print(counter)
for item in str1:
    counter[item] += 1
print(counter)

import collections
print(collections.Counter("hello"))
```



# Use of “get()” function


### **Ques. What is NumPy?**
* NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.


### **Ques. What is difference betweenr repr() and str()?**
the built-in str() and repr() functions both produce a textual representation of an object.
* **str():-** The str() function returns a user-friendly description of an object.
* **repr():-** The repr() method returns a developer-friendly string representation of an object.
```python
import datetime
today = datetime.datetime.now()
print(str(today))
print(repr(today))

Output:-
2021-08-14 08:18:25.138663
datetime.datetime(2021, 8, 14, 8, 18, 25, 138663)
```

```python
class Fruit:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        
banana = Fruit("Banana")
print(banana)

Output:- <__main__.Fruit object at 0x7f97c77704c0>
-----------------------------------------------------
class Fruit:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f'I am a {self.name}'
        
banana = Fruit("Banana")
print(banana)

Output:- I am a Banana
```

### **Ques. What is Scope Resolution in Python?**
* scope resolution in python follows the LEGB rules.
1. Local(L): Defined inside function/class
2. Enclosed(E): Defined inside enclosing functions(Nested function concept)
3. Global(G): Defined at the uppermost level
4. Built-in(B): Reserved names in Python builtin modules



* Local, Enclosed, and Global Scopes in Python
```python
pi = 'global pi variable'
  
def outer():
    pi = 'outer pi variable'
    def inner():
        # pi = 'inner pi variable'
        nonlocal pi
        print(pi)
    inner()
  
outer()
print(pi)

Output:-
outer pi variable
global pi variable
```



### What are Python namespaces?
A namespace in python refers to the name which is assigned to each object in python. The objects are variables and functions. As each object is created, its name along with space(the address of the outer function in which the object is), gets created. The namespaces are maintained in python like a dictionary where the key is the namespace and value is the address of the object. There 4 types of namespace in python-

Built-in namespace– These namespaces contain all the built-in objects in python and are available whenever python is running.
Global namespace– These are namespaces for all the objects created at the level of the main program.
Enclosing namespaces– These namespaces are at the higher level or outer function.
Local namespaces– These namespaces are at the local or inner function.




```python
a = "mohit kumar"
new_list = [1,2,3,4,3,2,1,5,6,7]
list4 = []
for item in a:
    list4.append(item)
print(list4)
list5 = []
[list5.append(item*5) for item in new_list if item not in list5]
print(list5)
dict1 = {}
# for item in List:
#   dict1[len(item)] = item
# print(dict1)
dict1 = {len(item): item  for item in List}
print(dict1)
abc = sorted(dict1)
list6 = [dict1[item] for item in abc]
print(list6)
```


### Unique dictionary from list?
```python
a = [
{'id':1,'name':'john', 'age':34},
{'id':1,'name':'john', 'age':34},
{'id':2,'name':'hanna', 'age':30},
]

b = {x['id']:x for x in a}.values()

print(b)

Output:-
dict_values([{'id': 1, 'name': 'john', 'age': 34}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'hanna', 'age': 30}])

### Ques. What is the purpose of the range() function?
* The range() function in Python is used to generate a sequence of numbers, which is often used for iterating over a loop a specific number of times. 
* The range() function can take up to three arguments:
  * start (optional): The starting value of the sequence (default is 0).
  * stop: The stopping value of the sequence. The sequence will go up to, but not include, this value.
  * step (optional): The difference between each number in the sequence (default is 1).

```python
# Using range with only one argument (stop)
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Using range with two arguments (start and stop)
for i in range(2, 8):
    print(i)  # Prints 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

# Using range with all three arguments (start, stop, step)
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)  # Prints 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
```

### **Ques. How do you open and close a file in Python?**
```python
file = open("example.txt", "r")  # Opens the file in read mode
content = file.read()  # Read the content of the file
print(content)
file.close()  # Close the file when done

```

AbstractUser vs AbstractBaseUser
The default User model in Django uses a username to uniquely identify a user during authentication. If you'd rather use an email address, you'll need to create a custom User model by either subclassing AbstractUser or AbstractBaseUser.

Options:

AbstractUser: Use this option if you are happy with the existing fields on the User model and just want to remove the username field.
AbstractBaseUser: Use this option if you want to start from scratch by creating your own, completely new User model.
