# **Sql**
### **Ques. What is database?**
* A database is an organized collection of data, stored and retrieved digitally from a remote or local computer system. Databases can be vast and complex, and such databases are developed using fixed design and modeling approaches.
* Database is nothing but an organized form of data for easy access, storing, retrieval and managing of data. 
* This is also known as structured form of data which can be accessed in many ways.

### **Ques. What is Sql?**
* SQL is stands for **structure query language**. 
* It is a database language **used** for database **creation**, **deletion**, **fetching** rows and modifying rows etc.
* It is a kind of ANSI standard language, used with all database. 

### **Ques. What Is DBMS?**
* A database management system is program that control creation, maintenance and use of a database.
* DBMS can be termed as File Manager that manages data in a database rather than saving it in ﬁle systems.

### **What is RDBMS?**
* RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS store the data into the collection of tables, which is related by common fields between the columns of the table. It also provides relational operators to manipulate the data stored into the tables.

### **Ques. Difference between DBMS & RDBMS?**
| DBMS                                          | RDBMS                                           |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| DBMS applications store data as file          | RDBMS applications store data in a tabular form |
| Normalization is not present in DBMS          | Normalization is present in RDBMS               |
| DBMS does not support distributed data hnbase | RDBMS support distributed database              |

# User Management 
#### Create User
```sql
CREATE USER username@hostname IDENTIFIED BY 'password';  
-- The hostname is optional then
CREATE USER username IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; 
```

#### Show all Users
```sql
select user from mysql.user;
+---------+
| User    |
+---------+
| root    |
| mohits4 |
+---------+
```
#### Show Current User
```sql
SELECT USER();
OR
Select current_user();
```

#### User Password Change
```sql
SET PASSWORD FOR 'mohits4'@'hostname' = PASSWORD('jtp12345');  
OR
ALTER USER mohits4@hostname IDENTIFIED BY 'jtp123';
```

#### Drop User
```sql
DROP USER mohits4@localhost;  
--can also be used to remove more than one user accounts at once.
DROP USER john@localhost, peter@localhost;  
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### Grant Privileges to the MySQL New User
1. **ALL PRIVILEGES**: It permits all privileges to a new user account.
2. **CREATE**: It enables the user account to create databases and tables.
3. **DROP**: It enables the user account to drop databases and tables.
4. **DELETE**: It enables the user account to delete rows from a specific table.
5. **INSERT**: It enables the user account to insert rows into a specific table.
6. **SELECT**: It enables the user account to read a database.
7. **UPDATE**: It enables the user account to update table rows.

[ ] Note:- Sometimes, you want to flush all the privileges of a user account for changes occurs immediately
```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

```sql
-- If you want to give all privileges to a newly created user, execute the following command.
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO username@hostname;

-- If you want to give specific privileges to a newly created user, execute the following command.
GRANT CREATE, SELECT, INSERT ON * . * TO username@hostname;
```

#### Show Privileges
```sql
SHOW GRANTS for mohits4;
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'local_user'@'localhost';
```

#### REVOKE Privileges
```sql
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* FROM 'mohits4'@'hostname';
-- If you want to remove specific privileges to a newly created user
REVOKE SELECT ON *.* FROM 'mohits4'@'hostname';
-- Revoke **all privileges** on a specific **database**:
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* FROM 'mohits4'@'hostname';
-- Revoke **SELECT privilege** on a **specific** **table**:
REVOKE SELECT ON database_name.table_name FROM 'mohits4'@'hostname';
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

# Database
#### Show Database
```sql
SHOW DATABASES/SCHEMAS;
SHOW DATABASES [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr];
SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'test%';
SELECT * FROM sys.databases;
EXEC sp_databases;
+---------------------+
| Database            |
+---------------------+
| employeesdb         |
| profile_fastapi     |
+---------------------+
```

#### Create Databse
```sql
CREATE DATABASE databasename;
```

```sql
RENAME DATABASE old_database_name TO new_database_name
(OR)
ALTER DATABASE old_datbase MODIFY NAME = new_database
```

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS DatabaseName;

-- Deleting Multiple Databases
DROP DATABASE testDB3, testDB4;
```

#### Select Database
```sql
USE YourDatabaseName;
```

# Tables
### **Types of SQL Commands/subsets of SQL?**
* DDL (Data Definition Language):
  * **[CREATE:](#create-table)** Creates a new table or database.
  * **[ALTER](#alter-table):** Modifies an existing database object.
  * **[DROP](#drop-column-in-table):** Deletes an entire table, database, or other objects.
  * **[TRUNCATE](#truncate):** Removes all records from a table, deleting the space allocated for the records.

* DML (Data Manipulation Language):
  * **SELECT:** Retrieves data from the database.
  * **INSERT:** Adds new data to a table.
  * **[UPDATE](#update):** Modifies existing data within a table.
  * **DELETE:** Removes data from a table.
* DCL (Data Control Language):
  * **GRANT:** Gives users access privileges to the database.
  * **REVOKE:** Removes access privileges given with the GRANT command.
* TCL (Transaction Control Language):
  * **COMMIT:** Saves all changes made in the current transaction.
  * **ROLLBACK:** Restores the database to the last committed state.
  * **SAVEPOINT:** Sets a savepoint within a transaction.
  * **SET TRANSACTION:** Places a name on a transaction.


### **Show tables;**
```sql
SHOW TABLES;
+-----------------------+
| Tables_in_employee123 |
+-----------------------+
| employee_table        |
+-----------------------+
```

### **select table**
```sql
use database_name;
```





<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>






# Common Questions
#### SQL Comments?
* There are typically two main types of SQL comments:
1. **Single-line Comments:** Started with two dashes (--)
```sql
-- This is a single-line comment
SELECT * FROM employees; -- Retrieve all employee records
```
2. **Multi-line Comments:** Started with /* and ended with */
```sql
/* This is a 
   multi-line comment 
   explaining the query */
SELECT id, name, email FROM employees;
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### **Ques. Difference between **CHAR** and **VARCHAR** data types?**
* Both of these data types are used for characters.
* **CHAR data** type is used to store **fixed-length** character strings. When VARCHAR data type is used to store **variable-length** character strings.
* char occupies all the space and if space is remaining, then it fill all the blank space with "space". But in case of varchar, It takes only the required length & release remaining.
```sql
Char -> 10      | R | A | M | space | space | sapce | space | space | space | space |
Varchar -> 10   | R | A | M |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| R | A | M |
```
* varchar is better than Char in term of space. 
* char perform is better than varchar.
* Char max 256 characters, varchar 65535 characters.
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### **Ques. Difference between In and Between Operator in SQL?**
* BETWEEN operator is used to **select a range of data between two values** while The IN operator allows you to **specify multiple values**.
* The BETWEEN operator selects a range of data between two values. The values can be numbers, text,etc.
```sql
+----+----------+--------+
| ID | NAME     | mark   |
+----+----------+--------+
|  1 | Ramesh   |   89   |
|  2 | Khilan   |   81   |
|  3 | kaushik  |   73   |
|  3 | kaushik  |   67   |
|  4 | Chaitali |   52   |
+----+----------+--------+

-- between
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE marks BETWEEN 50 AND 80
+----+----------+--------+
| ID | NAME     | mark   |
+----+----------+--------+
|  3 | kaushik  |   73   |
|  3 | kaushik  |   67   |
|  4 | Chaitali |   52   |
+----+----------+--------+

-- In
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE marks IN (89,73)
+----+----------+--------+
| ID | NAME     | mark   |
+----+----------+--------+
|  1 | Ramesh   |   89   |
|  3 | kaushik  |   73   |
+----+----------+--------+
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### **Ques. IN and NOT IN Operator?**
#### **IN Operator**
* The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions, It reduces the use of multiple OR conditions in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries.
* The IN operator is used to retrieves results when the specified value matches any value in a set of values or is returned by a subquery. 
* This operator allows us to specify multiple values along with the WHERE clause. 
```sql
select * from customers
+----+----------+-----+-----------+-----------+
| cust_id | cust_name | city      | occupation|
+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|  1      | Peter     | Londen    | Business  |
|  2      | Joseph    | Texas     | Doctor    |
|  3      | Mark      | New Delhi | Engineer  |        
|  4      | Michael   | New York  | Scientist |
|  5      | Alexander | Maxico    | Student   |
+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
mysql> SELECT * FROM customer WHERE occupation IN ('Doctor', 'Scientist', 'Engineer');

+----+----------+-----+-----------+-----------+
| cust_id | cust_name | city      | occupation|
+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|  2      | Joseph    | Texas     | Doctor    |
|  3      | Mark      | New Delhi | Engineer  |        
|  4      | Michael   | New York  | Scientist |
+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
```

#### **NOT IN Operator**
* selects all customers that are located in "Texas", or "New York":
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE city NOT IN ('Texas', 'New York');

Output:-
+----+----------+-----+-----------+-----------+
| cust_id | cust_name | city      | occupation|
+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|  1      | Peter     | Londen    | Business  |
|  3      | Mark      | New Delhi | Engineer  |        
|  5      | Alexander | Maxico    | Student   |
+---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### **Ques. BETWEEN and NOT BETWEEN Operator?**
#### **BETWEEN**
* The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.
* The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included.
```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```
#### **NOT BETWEEN**
* To display the products outside the range of the previous example, use NOT BETWEEN:
```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name
WHERE column_name NOT BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### What is Aggregate function?
```sql
-- Sum() :- The SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column. 
SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;

-- AVG():- The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column. 
SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;

-- MAX() :- The MAX() function returns the largest value of the selected column.
SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;

-- Min():- The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column.
SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;

-- count():- The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.
SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>


### SQL Operators and Clauses
### **SELECT**
* SELECT statements are used to fetch data from a database. Every query will begin with SELECT.
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;   -- fetch Full data
SELECT column_name FROM table_name;     -- fetch particular column
```

### **UPDATE**
* UPDATE statements allow you to edit rows in a table.
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET some_column = some_value
WHERE some_column = some_value;
```

### **DELETE**
* DELETE statements are used to remove rows from a table.
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE some_column = some_value;
```

#### **IF()**
```sql
SELECT IF(200>350,'YES','NO'); -- Output:- NO
SELECT IF(251 = 251,' Correct','Wrong');  -- Output:- Correct

--
SELECT salary, IF(salary>3000,"Mature","Immature") As Result FROM employee;
+---------+----------+
| salary  | Result   |
+---------+----------+
| 2957.00 | Immature |
| 3100.00 | Mature   |
+---------+----------+
```
```sql
SELECT IF(STRCMP('Rinky Ponting','Yuvraj Singh')=0, 'Correct', 'Wrong');
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### **IFNULL()**
* If the first expression is not NULL, it will return the first expression, which is 'Hello' value.
```sql
SELECT IFNULL("Hello", "javaTpoint");   # Output:- Hello
```
```sql
SELECT IFNULL(NULL,5);  # Output:- 5
```
```sql
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| emp_name  | cellphone | homephone |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| mohit     | 2531452   |  NULL     |
| Krishna   | NULL      | 345634634 |
| shivani   | 551113    | NULL      |
| akshra    | NULL      | 6574576   |
| abhinav   | NULL      | 674576457 |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
SELECT emp_name, IFNULL(cellphone, homephone) phone  FROM  student_contact;
+-----------+-----------+
| emp_name  | phone     |
+-----------+-----------+
| mohit     | 2531452   |

| abhinav   | 674576457 |
+-----------+-----------+
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### **NULLIF()**
* The NULLIF function accepts two expressions, and if the first expression is equal to the second expression, it returns the NULL. Otherwise, it returns the first expression.
```sql
SELECT NULLIF("javaTpoint", "javaTpoint");  # Output:- NULL
```
```sql
SELECT NULLIF("Hello", "404");  # Output:- Hello
```
```sql
+---------+----------------+-------------+--------+---------------+
| cust_id | cust_name      | occupation  | income | qualification |
+---------+----------------+-------------+--------+---------------+
|       1 | John Miller    | Developer   | 20000  | Btech         |

+---------+----------------+-------------+--------+---------------+


SELECT cust_name, occupation, qualification, NULLIF (qualification,"Btech") result FROM customer;
Output:-
+----------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
| cust_name      | occupation  | qualification | result |
+----------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
| John Miller    | Developer   | Btech         | NULL   |

| Adam Obama     | Manager     | MBA           | MBA    |
| Rincky Ponting | Cricketer   | Btech         | NULL   |
+----------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### **IS NULL and IS NOT NULL**
* IS NULL and IS NOT NULL are operators used with the WHERE clause to test for empty values.
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;
```

#### **ROUND()**
* The ROUND() function is used to round a numeric value to a specified number of decimal places.*
* syntex:- syntex:- ROUND(number, decimal_places)
```sql
SELECT ROUND(123.4567, 2);  -- Returns 123.46
SELECT ROUND(123.4567, 0);  -- Returns 123
SELECT ROUND(123.4567, -1); -- Returns 120 (rounds to the nearest 10)

-- example:-
SELECT ROUND(salary, 2) AS rounded_salary FROM employees;
```

#### BETWEEN()
* The BETWEEN operator is used to filter the result set within a certain range. The values can be numbers, text or dates.
```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value_1 AND value_2;
```

#### **AND**
* AND is an operator that **combines two conditions**. **Both conditions must be true** for the row to be included in the result set.
* The MySQL AND Condition (also called the AND Operator) is used to test two or more conditions in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_1 = value_1
  AND column_2 = value_2;

SELECT * FROM contacts
WHERE state = 'California'
AND contact_id > 3000;
```


#### **OR**
* OR is an operator that filters the result set to only include rows where either condition is true.
```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name = value_1
   OR column_name = value_2;
```

#### **Case**
* CASE statements are used to create different outputs (usually in the SELECT statement). It is SQL’s way of handling if-then logic.
```sql
SELECT column_name,
  CASE
    WHEN condition THEN 'Result_1'
    WHEN condition THEN 'Result_2'
    ELSE 'Result_3'
  END
FROM table_name;
```


#### **GROUP BY**
* GROUP BY is a clause in SQL that is only used with aggregate functions. It is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to arrange identical data into groups.
```sql
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```

#### **HAVING**
* HAVING was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.
```sql
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > value;
```

#### **LIMIT**
* LIMIT is a clause that lets you specify the maximum number of rows the result set will have.
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
LIMIT number;
```

#### **ORDER BY**
* ORDER BY is a clause that indicates you want to sort the result set by a particular column either alphabetically or numerically.
```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name ASC | DESC;
```

#### **SELECT DISTINCT**
* SELECT DISTINCT specifies that the statement is going to be a query that returns unique values in the specified column(s).
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name;
```

#### **With**
* WITH clause lets you store the result of a query in a temporary table using an alias. You can also define multiple temporary tables using a comma and with one instance of the WITH keyword.
* The WITH clause is also known as common table expression (CTE) and subquery factoring.
```sql
WITH temporary_name AS (
   SELECT *
   FROM table_name)
SELECT *
FROM temporary_name
WHERE column_name operator value;
```

#### **WHERE**
* WHERE is a clause that indicates you want to filter the result set to include only rows where the following condition is true.
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator value;
```

# Keys
#### Primary Key?
* A PRIMARY KEY is a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a database table.
* A Primary Key column cannot have Null values.
* A table can have only one primary key per table.
* When multiple fields are used as a primary key, they are called a composite key.

```sql
-- Create Primary Key
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
-- (OR)
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id) 
);

-- Create Primary Key with multiple column
CREATE TABLE Order_Items (
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)  -- Multiple columns as primary key
);
```

#### Add primary Key
```sql
-- if primary key doesn’t exists in the created table 
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY (Id)

-- For multiple column 
ALTER table Employee ADD constraints PK_Employee PRIMARY KEY (column_name1, column_name2);
-- (OR)
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY (column1, column2);

-- Adding Primary Key with Auto-Increment
ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY;
```

#### Delete primary Key
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP PRIMARY KEY;

-- For multiple column 
ALTER TABLE Employee DROP CONSTRAINT PK_Employee;
-- (OR)
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP PRIMARY KEY;
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>


#### Ques. What Is Unique Key?
* A Unique Key is a constraint that ensures all values in a column or a combination of columns are unique across all records in a table.
* The Unique and Primary Key constraints both provide a guarantee for a column or set of columns.
* A Primary Key consist automatically has a unique constraint define on it.
  * Defining unique key
```sql
-- Single Column Unique Key
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);

-- Multiple Column Unique Key
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    UNIQUE (first_name, last_name)
);
```

#### ALTER unique key
```sql
-- Single Column
ALTER table Employee ADD UNIQUE(column name);
-- (OR)
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name UNIQUE (column_name);

-- Multiple Columns
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name UNIQUE (column1, column2);
``` 

#### Drop unique key
```sql
ALTER TABLE Employee DROP CONSTRAINT Employee_ID;
-- (OR)
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP INDEX constraint_name;
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>


### **Ques. What Is Foreign Key?**
* A foreign key is a key used to link two tables together. This is something called a reference key.
* A column or set of columns in a table that references the PRIMARY KEY of another table.
* Foreign key is a column or a combination of columns whose values match a primary key in a different table.
* The relationship between two tables matches the primary key in one of the tables with a foreign key in the second table.

```sql
-- create Customers table
CREATE TABLE Customers (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  age INTEGER
);

-- create Products table
CREATE TABLE Products (
    customer_id INTEGER ,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
    REFERENCES Customers(id)
);

-- Here, the customer_id column in the Products table references the id column in the Customers table.
```
```sql
-- One-to-One:- Each record in one table connects to single record in another
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    passport_number INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (passport_number) 
    REFERENCES Passport(passport_number)
);

-- One-to-Many:- One record in parent table can relate to multiple records in child table
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) 
    REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);

-- Many-to-Many:- Multiple records in both tables can relate to each other
CREATE TABLE StudentCourses (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES Courses(course_id)
);
```

#### Adding Foreign Key to Existing Table?
```sql
-- if primary key doesn’t exists in the created table
ALTER TABLE Employee ADD FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES Department(department_id);
(OR)
ALTER TABLE `bookings` ADD CONSTRAINT `advance_bookings_user_id_foreign` FOREIGN KEY (`user_id`) REFERENCES `users` (`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE

-- For multiple column
ALTER TABLE Employee ADD CONSTRAINT FK_dept_id FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES Department(department_id);
```

#### DROP a Foreign Key from the table
```sql
-- For single column/multiple column
ALTER TABLE Employee DROP FOREIGN KEY FK_dept_id;
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>



#### Ques. What is Composite Key?
* Composite key is combination of two or more columns that can uniquely identify each row in the table.
* composite key is also a primary key, but the difference is that it is made by the combination of more than one column to identify the particular row in the table.
* A composite key cannot be null.
```sql
CREATE TABLE student
(rollNumber INT, 
name VARCHAR(30), 
class VARCHAR(30), 
section VARCHAR(1), 
mobile VARCHAR(10),
PRIMARY KEY (rollNumber, mobile));
```

#### Types of Composite Keys
1. Composite Primary Key
```sql
CREATE TABLE StudentCourses (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    semester VARCHAR(10),
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id, semester)
);
```
2. Composite Unique Key
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    UNIQUE (first_name, last_name, department)
);
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>


#### Ques. Difference between Primary Key & Unique Key?

# Joins
#### Ques. What Is Joins?
* A JOIN is a method used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
* MySQL JOINS are used with SELECT statement.

#### Many types of MySQL joins:
1. Self Join
2. Inner Join
3. Left JOIN
4. Right JOIN
5. Full Join
6. Outer Join
7. Cross Join 


#### Self Join
* A self join connects a table to itself. Used when you want to compare rows within the same table.
```sql
Customers table:                                      
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+        
| ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |        
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+        
|  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 |        
|  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 |        
|  3 | kaushik  |  23 | Kota      |  2000.00 |        
|  4 | Chaitali |  25 | Mumbai    |  6500.00 |        
|  5 | Hardik   |  27 | Bhopal    |  8500.00 |   
|  6 | Komal    |  22 | MP        |  4500.00 |
|  7 | Muffy    |  24 | Indore    | 10000.00 |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+

-- Example
SELECT c1.NAME AS Customer1, c2.NAME AS Customer2, c1.SALARY FROM Customers c1
JOIN Customers c2 ON c1.SALARY = c2.SALARY AND c1.ID < c2.ID;
-- Output:
+------------+------------+----------+
| Customer1  | Customer2  | SALARY   |
+------------+------------+----------+
| Ramesh     | kaushik    | 2000.00  |
+------------+------------+----------+
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### INNER JOIN
* The MySQL Inner Join is used to returns only those results from the tables that **match** the specified condition and hides other rows and columns.
* Inner join: Inner join return rows when there is at least one match of rows between the tables.
```sql
Customers table:                                      
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+

```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### Left JOIN/LEFT OUTER JOIN
* The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (the table listed first), and the matching records (if any) from the right table (table2).
```sql
CUSTOMERS Table
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+ 
| ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
|  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 |
|  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 |

| 103 | 2008-05-20 00:00:00 |           4 |   2060 |
+-----+---------------------+-------------+--------+

SQL> SELECT  ID, NAME, AMOUNT, DATE FROM CUSTOMERS LEFT JOIN ORDERS
   ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID;

Result:-
+----+----------+--------+---------------------+
| ID | NAME     | AMOUNT | DATE                |

|  7 | Muffy    |   NULL | NULL                |
+----+----------+--------+---------------------+
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### Right JOIN
* The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns **all records** from the **right table** (table2), and the **matching records** (if any) from the **left table** (table1).
```sql
-- Customers Table
+----+----------+
| ID | NAME     |
+----+----------+
|  1 | Ramesh   |
|  2 | Khilan   |
|  3 | Kaushik  |

-- Orders Table
+----------+------------+
| OrderID  | CustomerID |
+----------+------------+
|   101    |     2      |
|   102    |     3      |
|   103    |     4      |
+----------+------------+

-- RIGHT JOIN Result
SELECT Customers.NAME, Orders.OrderID FROM Customers RIGHT JOIN Orders 
ON Customers.ID = Orders.CustomerID;
+----------+------------+
| NAME     | OrderID    |
+----------+------------+
| Khilan   |   101      |
| Kaushik  |   102      |
| NULL     |   103      |
+----------+------------+
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### Outer join
* Returns all rows from both tables, Matching and non-matching rows.
* NULL values where no match exists
```sql
SELECT column_list
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

```sql
-- Example query
employees:

| employee_id | employee_name | department_id |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1           | John Smith    | 101           |
| 2           | Mary Johnson  | 102           |
| 3           | Sam Brown     | 103           |

departments:

| department_id | department_name |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 101           | HR              |
| 102           | Finance         |
| 104           | Marketing       |

SELECT employees.employee_id, employees.employee_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;

| employee_id | employee_name | department_name |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | John Smith    | HR              |
| 2           | Mary Johnson  | Finance         |
| 3           | Sam Brown     | NULL            |
| NULL        | NULL          | Marketing       |
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>


#### CROSS Join
* The CROSS JOIN keyword returns all records from both tables (table1 and table2).
* If you have a Products table with 3 products and a Colors table with 2 colors, a CROSS JOIN would return a result set with 6 combinations (3 * 2):
```sql
-- Products table
| ProductID | ProductName |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 1         | T-Shirt     |
| 2         | Jeans       |

-- Colors table
| ColorID | Color |
| ------- | ----- |
| 1       | Red   |
| 2       | Blue  |

-- Output:-
SELECT Products.ProductName, Colors.Color
FROM Products
CROSS JOIN Colors;

| ProductName | Color |
| ----------- | ----- |
| T-Shirt     | Red   |
| T-Shirt     | Blue  |
| Jeans       | Red   |
| Jeans       | Blue  |

```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### Full Join/FULL OUTER JOIN
* A FULL JOIN (also called a FULL OUTER JOIN) returns all rows when there is a match in either left (table1) or right (table2) table. It returns all records from both tables, and the result set will have NULL values for columns where there is no match.
#### Key Points:
* Rows from both tables are included even if there is no match.
* If there is no match, the columns from the table that doesn’t have a match will contain NULL.
* This join is useful when you want to retrieve all records, whether or not there's a match in both tables.

```sql
-- Employees Table:
| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1          | John         | 10           |
| 2          | Jane         | 20           |
| 3          | Mike         | 30           |
| 4          | Sara         | NULL         |

-- Departments Table:
| DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| 10           | HR             |
| 20           | IT             |
| 30           | Sales          |
| 40           | Marketing      |

-- Output:-

# Index
#### What is Index?
* An index is used to enhance the performance of SQL Queries. It allows the database to find data quickly and efficiently by using Row ID, avoiding full table scans.
* Indexes can be created on one or more columns of a table.
* Index allows the database application to find data fast, without reading the whole table.
* An index can be created in a table to find data more quickly and efficiently.
* **How It Works:-** Behind the scenes, an index is usually implemented as a B-tree or similar structure.

#### Types of Indexes?
1. **Single-column index:-** on one column
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_product_id ON Sales (product_id);
```
2. **Composite/Multi-column indexes:** on multiple columns
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_dept_salary ON employees(department, salary);
```
3. Unique Index:- 
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email_unique ON employees(email);
```
4. Full-Text Index :- Designed for efficient text search in large text fields (e.g., for searching keywords in articles, product descriptions, etc.)
```sql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_description ON products(description);
```

#### Show Index
```sql
show index from table_name
```

#### Unique Indexes
* A Unique Index is a database index that ensures the uniqueness of values in one or more columns of a database table.
* This index ensures that no two rows in the Employees table have the same employee_id(Colum_name), which maintains data integrity and prevents duplicate entries.
* The SQL Unique Index ensures that no two rows in the indexed columns of a table have the same values (no duplicate values allowed).
```sql
* Behind the scenes, when a new record is inserted, the database would:
  * Check the Index: It looks up the email in the index (which could be a B-tree or hash table) to find if that email already exists.
    * The database will search the index, and it will quickly identify whether the email you're trying to insert is already in the table.
  * Check for Duplicates:
    * For example, if we try to insert a new row:
    * INSERT INTO users (Name, Email) VALUES ('David', 'alice@example.com');
    * The database will search the unique index for the email alice@example.com. Since this email already exists in the index, the insert will fail with an error like:
    "Duplicate entry 'alice@example.com' for key 'idx_unique_email'".
```
```sql
-- Single column unique index
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email ON users(email);

-- Composite unique index
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_name_age ON employees(last_name, first_name);
```

#### Alter/Modify an Index
```sql
-- Rename Index name
ALTER TABLE table_name 
RENAME INDEX old_index_name TO new_index_name;

-- Modify Index name
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP INDEX existing_index,
ADD INDEX new_index (column1, column2);

-- Rebuild Index
ALTER INDEX index_name 
ON table_name REBUILD;

-- Reorganize Index
ALTER INDEX index_name 
ON table_name REORGANIZE;

-- Disable Index
ALTER INDEX index_name 
ON table_name DISABLE;

-- Change Index Properties
ALTER INDEX index_name 
ON table_name 
SET (
    STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF,
    ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON,
    ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON
);
```

#### Drop Index 
```sql
Drop index index_name on table_name
(OR) DROP INDEX table_name.index_name;

-- DROP INDEX with IF EXISTS
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS index_name
ON table_name;


ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;
```

#### Cluster Index
* A clustered index is an index where the data in the table is physically stored in the order of the indexed column. In other words, the rows of the table are sorted on disk based on the values in the indexed column. A table can have only one clustered index because the data can only be sorted in one way.
* **Example:** If you create a clustered index on the EmployeeID column, the table rows will be stored on disk in ascending order of EmployeeID. The clustered index itself dictates the physical arrangement of the data.
* jab kisi table par hum primary key lagate hai to wo cluster index ban jata hai.

##### Non cluster index
* A non-clustered index is an index where the data in the table is stored independently of the index. It creates a separate structure that contains the indexed column(s) and pointers to the actual rows in the table. A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes, allowing for efficient lookups on different columns without changing the physical order of the data.
* **Example:** If you create a non-clustered index on the Department column, the index will store the department values along with pointers to the corresponding rows in the table, but the table data itself remains in its original order.
* table mai jis column par select command sabse jyda chalte hai to us column par hum non cluster index bna lete hai.

#### Ques. What is the difference between cluster and non cluster index?

| Cluster index                                   | Non cluster index                                        |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data rows are stored in the order of the index. | Data rows are not sorted in any particular order.        |
| Only one clustered index per table.             | Multiple non-clustered indexes can exist per table.      |
| Created by default for the primary key.         | Must be explicitly created (e.g., for specific queries). |

# View
### **What is View?**
* A view is a **virtual table** based on the result set of a SELECT query.
* It does not store data itself but provides a way to look at data from one or more tables in a structured and reusable manner.
* It **behaves** like a **table** but **doesn't store** the **data physically**.

### **Create view**
```sql
Create view view_name As
Select column1, column2
From  table_name  
Where [condition];
```
#### **Show view**
```sql
SELECT * FROM view_name;
```

#### **Alter view**
* CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Syntax
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

#### **Deleted view**
* A view is **deleted** with the **DROP VIEW statement**.
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS view_name;
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

# Wildcard Characters/Like Query
#### Ques. Wildcard Characters?
* Wildcard characters are used with the **LIKE operator**. The LIKE operator is **used** in a **WHERE** clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

| Symbol | Description                        |
| :----- | :--------------------------------- |
| %      | Represents zero or more characters |
| _      | Represents a single character      |

##### Some Example
| LIKE Operator                   | Description                                                                   |
| :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'    | Finds any values that starts with "a"                                         |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'    | Finds any values that ends with "a"                                           |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'  | Finds any values that have "or" in any position                               |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'   | Finds any values that have "r" in the second position                         |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%_%' | Finds any values that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length |
| WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'    | Finds any values that starts with "a" and ends with "o"                       |

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE 'ber%';
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### Aliases?
* AS is a keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or table using an alias.
* Aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
* An alias is created with the **AS** keyword.

#### Alias Column Syntax:-
```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name FROM table_name;

-- Basic Column Alias
SELECT first_name AS name, last_name AS surname FROM employees;

-- Using quotes for aliases with spaces
SELECT 
    first_name AS 'Employee First Name',
    last_name AS 'Employee Last Name',
    salary AS 'Monthly Compensation'
FROM 
    employees;
    
-- Without AS keyword
SELECT first_name name, last_name surname FROM employees;

-- Simple Table Alias
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e JOIN departments d 
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

-- Calculation with Alias
SELECT 
    product_name, 
    price * quantity AS total_value,
    (price * quantity) * 1.1 AS total_with_tax
FROM products;

-- Concatenation Alias
SELECT 
    CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
    email AS contact_email
FROM customers;

-- Subquery with Alias
SELECT 
    (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) AS avg_salary,
    (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees) AS max_salary;







-- Aggregate Function Aliases
SELECT 
    department_id,
    AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
    COUNT(*) AS employee_count,
    MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;

-- Conditional Aliases
SELECT 
    first_name,
    last_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN salary < 50000 THEN 'Junior'
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000 THEN 'Mid-Level'
        ELSE 'Senior'
    END AS salary_category
FROM employees;
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### Ques. What Is Union & Union All?
* Both UNION and UNION ALL Operator combine rows from result sets into a single result set.
  
#### UNION
* The union operator **combines** the results of two or more select statements by **removing duplicate rows**.
* The columns and the data types must be the same in select statements.
```sql
+----+----------+    
| ID | NAME     |       
+----+----------+      
|  1 | Ramesh   |     
|  2 | Khilan   |       
|  3 | kaushik  |       
+----+----------+

+----+----------+    
| ID | NAME     |       
+----+----------+      
|  3 | kaushik  |     
|  4 | Mohit    |       
|  5 | abhay    |       
+----+----------+

Select Column1, Column2, Column3 from Table A
UNION
Select Column1, Column2, Column3 from Table B

+----+----------+    
| ID | NAME     |       
+----+----------+      
|  1 | Ramesh   |     
|  2 | Khilan   |       
|  3 | kaushik  |       
|  4 | Mohit    |       
|  5 | abhay    |
+----+----------+
```
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### UNION ALL
* The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To **allow duplicate values**, use UNION ALL
```sql
Select Column1, Column2, Column3 from Table A
UNION ALL
Select Column1, Column2, Column3 from Table B

+----+----------+
| ID | NAME     |
+----+----------+
|  1 | Ramesh   |
|  2 | Khilan   |
|  3 | kaushik  |
|  3 | kaushik  |
|  4 | Mohit    |
|  5 | abhay    |
+----+----------+
```

### **Ques. Difference between Union & Union All?**
| Union                                                     | Union All                                     |
| :-------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Union removes duplicate rows.                             | Union All does not remove the duplicate rows. |
| Union uses a distinct sort                                | Union All does not use a distinct sort        |
| Union can’t work with a column that has a text data type. | Union All can work with all data type column. |
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

#### What is Intersect?
* The INTERSECT statement will return only those rows that are **identical/common** to both of the SELECT statements from two or more tables
```sql
-- Employees                          -- Managers
| EmpID | EmpName | Department |  | EmpID | EmpName | Department |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- || ----- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1     | Alice   | HR         |      | 2     | Bob     | IT         |
| 2     | Bob     | IT         |      | 4     | David   | IT         |
| 3     | Charlie | Finance    |      | 6     | Frank   | Sales      |
| 4     | David   | IT         |      | 7     | Grace   | Marketing  |
| 5     | Eve     | Marketing  |

-- Output
SELECT EmpID, EmpName, Department FROM Employees
INTERSECT
SELECT EmpID, EmpName, Department FROM Managers;
| EmpID | EmpName | Department |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- |
| 2     | Bob     | IT         |
| 4     | David   | IT         |

```

#### What is MINUS?
* MINUS operator will return only those rows which are **unique** in only first SELECT query and not those rows which are common to both first and second SELECT queries.
```sql
-- Employees                        -- Managers
| EmpID | EmpName | Department |  | EmpID | EmpName | Department |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- || ----- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1     | Alice   | HR         |    | 2     | Bob     | IT         |
| 2     | Bob     | IT         |    | 4     | David   | IT         |
| 3     | Charlie | Finance    |    | 6     | Frank   | Sales      |
| 4     | David   | IT         |    | 7     | Grace   | Marketing  |
| 5     | Eve     | Marketing  |

-- output:-
SELECT EmpID, EmpName, Department FROM Employees
MINUS
SELECT EmpID, EmpName, Department FROM Managers;
| EmpID | EmpName | Department |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1     | Alice   | HR         |
| 3     | Charlie | Finance    |
| 5     | Eve     | Marketing  |

### **Nth highest salary?**
* Using the LIMIT Clause
  * The limit clause has two components, the **First component** is to skip a number of rows from the top and the **second component** is to display the number of rows we want.
```sql
-- Syntex:- Using Limit
Select DISTINCT Salary from table_name order by Salary DESC limit n-1,1;
(OR) SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET N-1;
+----------+---------+
| emp_name | salary  |
+----------+---------+
| JONAS    | 2957.00 |
+----------+---------+

-- Example:- 4th Highest salary using limit
Select DISTINCT emp_name, salary from Employee order by salary DESC limit 3,1;

-- Using Subquery:- 3rd higest salery
SELECT MAX(salary) AS ThirdHighestSalary FROM Employee WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee));
+-------------+
| MAX(salary) |
+-------------+
|     2957.00 |
