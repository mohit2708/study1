### Ques. What is service container?
* Service container is a powerful tool for managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection.
* Service container is like a container where we define how the dependency should be resolved.
* its manage the class depandancy, hame bar bar kisi service ka or class ka object nahi banana padta hai.
* sevice container sabhi services ke object rakhta hai.
* **Class depandancy:-** jab ek class apne constracter method ke through ek dusri class ka object accept karta hai to usko depandacy injacrtion bolte hai.


#### Benefits of using service container
* create object of the class only once and use it everywhere.
* memory managment
* easy to change in code
* easy to test.

#### What is dependency injection?
* Dependency Injection means that class dependencies are “injected” into the class via the constructor or, in some cases, “setter” methods. Mostly constructor is used for injecting the dependency.
